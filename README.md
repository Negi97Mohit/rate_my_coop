# Rate My Dorm

Rate My Dorm is a web application designed to simplify and enhance the dormitory selection process for students. This user-friendly platform allows students to upload and share photos of their dorm rooms, providing a real and unfiltered glimpse into various on-campus housing options. Other users can then browse these images and rate them, fostering a community-driven resource that helps new and prospective students find dorms that best suit their preferences and needs.
